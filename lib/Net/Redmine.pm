=head1 NAME

Net::Redmine - A mechanized-based programming API against redmine server.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Redmine;

  my $r = Net::Redmine->new(
      url => $server,
      user => $user,
      password => $password
  );

  # Create a new ticket
  my $t1 = $r->create(
      ticket => {
          subject => "bug in the bag!",
          description => "please eliminate the bug for me",
      }
  );

  # Load an existing one.
  my $t2 = $r->lookup(
      ticket => {
          id => 42
      }
  );

  # copy a ticket
  my $t3 = $r->copy (
      ticket => {
          id => 42,  # id of the original ticket we want to copy
          subject => "new subject",
          description => "a description",
      }
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Redmine is an mechanized-based programming API against redmine server.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new(url => ..., user => ..., password => ...)

Constructor. You need to construct a C<Net::Redmine> object before you
can do anything. The parameters to this function is a list of
key-value pairs. All of these 3 pairs are required.

The C<url> should points to a project url. Like http://example.org/projects/foo.
It's the one that points you to the project overview tab.

The user and the password are the login credentials to login this
project.

Notice: One C<Net::Redmine> object can only handles one project on a
redmine server. You should create multiple C<Net::Redmine> objects if
you're trying to manipulate multiple project at the same program.

=item create( ticket => { ... } )

The C<create> instance method can create tickets. In the future releases
it could also be used to create other kinds of assets.

The value to the C<ticket> key is a HashRef that should at least
contain C<subject> and <description> of the ticket. For example:

    my $t = $r->create(ticket => {
        subject => "Got a bug",
        description => "Found a bug in the bag"
    });

The returned value of this method is a C<Net::Redmine::Ticket> object.
Also read the document of that class to see how to use it.

=item copy( ticket => {id => Integer, ... } }

The C<copy> instance method can copy an existing ticket. The id is the id
of the original ticket we want to copy. The other values to the C<ticket>
key is the same hashref as for C<create>.

=item lookup( ticket => { id => Integer } }

Given a ticket id, this instance method load the ticket content from
the server, it also returns a C<Net::Redmine::Ticket> object.

At this point, only C<id> can be specified.
